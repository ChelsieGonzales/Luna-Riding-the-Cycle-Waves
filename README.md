# Luna-Riding-the-Cycle-Waves

#### I. Project Overview
Luna is a Java-based console application for period tracking, allowing users to monitor their moods, symptoms, and menstrual cycle. By tracking these factors, Luna helps users understand their body’s responses to menstruation. Key features include next period prediction and the chance of getting pregnant on a chosen date, supporting health management, pregnancy planning, and prevention. The project’s goal is to empower individuals to take control of their menstrual health, contributing to a healthier society.

This project aims to support SDG 3 by helping users manage their menstrual health, potentially reducing risks associated with unplanned pregnancies.
